              Web developer | London
            </h3>
            <div>
              <p>I have recently finished a Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly London. It was an intensive 12 week course the took me from a beginner in HTML and JavaScript, to deploying Full-Stack applications built with tools such as React, MongoDB, Express and Node.js. The pace of new topics and content was fierce but I found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.</p>

              <p>Previously, I worked for Micro-Power Electronics Ltd., a small electronics company that creates equipment for the power industry. I was tasked with creating a dashboard to show data from industrial sensors. Through my own learning and internal assistance, I was able to gain the skills necessary to integrate the data and create client side visualisations. I discovered I really enjoyed working in JavaScript and learning web technologies. This created a desire to formalise my training as a full stack developer and why I joined General Assembly.</p>

              <p>I am looking for a workplace that can provide me with challenges and surround me with experienced colleagues who I can learn from. I want to be able to progress as a developer by learning new skills and by being given greater responsibilities.</p>

                <h3>Soft Skills:</h3>

                <h3>Communication &amp; Teamwork</h3>
                <p>Respect, Empathy, Listening, Conflict Management, Cooperation, Negotiating</p>

                <button onclick="toggleHidden(&#39;#communicationTeamwork&#39;)">Example:</button>
                <p id="communicationTeamwork" class="hidden">When working on a group project at General Assembly, I found that members of the team wanted different levels of face to face communication, with some team members disturbing others whilst they were working hard and trying to concentrate. I opened a dialog to resolve the conflict, and by listening to everyone in the group with respect and empathy we came to a solution; regular scheduled meetings, so that people could feel included in the team but also allow those that needed their own space to thrive. This led to a much happier and more productive environment.</p>

                <h3>Adaptability, Problem Solving &amp; Creativity</h3>
                <p>self-motivation,  self-learning, persistence</p>

                <button onclick="toggleHidden(&#39;#adaptability&#39;)">Example:</button>
                <p id="adaptability" class="hidden">Micro-Power Electronics creates electronic sensors for the power industry and was commissioned to create a device to collect sensor data and run an internal web server so that they could be configured and their internal logs be downloaded from a web browser. I researched online and followed tutorials to learn the basics of HTML and JavaScript and how to incorporate them into an embedded C project on the device’s PIC32 microcontroller. This self-motivation was crucial as during the project, I was often working on my own and would frequently hit problems. Through persistence, experimentation and, importantly, asking for help I was able to overcome these issues. The end result was a product that exceeded the clients expectations and changed the project from a system tool, to a product that can be used to generate customers.</p>

                  <p>Brief: Create a Python/PostgreSQL backend and a React frontend with some unit testing.</p>
                  <p>Description: JamDex is an online music creation and sharing tool built using the Tone.js JavaScript library, React, PostgreSQL and Python.</p>

                  <p>It was created by myself, JAMes Benson and DEXter De Leon. Not only is it a nice portmanteau of our names, it is also a literal index of jams!</p>

                  <p>Using two instruments, a synthesizer and drum-machine, users can create single four beat bar loops we call Jams. These Jams can then be ‘recorded’ to tape and shared with others.</p>

                  <!-- <p>I was responsible for the creation of the instrument components using Tone.js and the control system for sending information from the interfaces to the sound engines. I setup the database models and schema as well as the RESTful routes. Using Enzyme, Mocha and Chai I created tests for the front end and did some of the styling of the instruments.</p>

                  <p>We started the project by firstly making some sound with Tone.js. Then getting Tone instruments built into react components, and making sure they can be synchronized. We then created simple ‘Alpha’ interfaces and the backend to save the pitch and velocity data. As we created ‘Beta’ interfaces, new models were created to handle extra functionality, such as synthesizer settings, and extra voices for the drum machine. We then created final interfaces and styled the whole site.</p> -->

With integrated search of the NPM library using keywords, users are able to see the description and usage statistics of node packages. Users can create representations of their node projects, add their current node packages to it and comment on the packages or other projects.

              The project had three models and we were each able to experience the backend, testing and front end for our own model. I was responsible for creating the Packages model and schema for the database, and their RESTful routes. I also created the packages Index and Show pages on the website, and am responsible for the colour choice and overall styling.
